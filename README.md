# ExtFriend

ExtFriend is a USB adapter for the WonderSwan's EXT port based on the RP2040 chip and the Raspberry Pi Pico board, providing the following features at a low cost:

* A USB serial port communicating with the WonderSwan at 9600 and 38400 baud,
* A USB audio device allowing digital stereo audio capture from the WonderSwan.

Both features can be active simultaneously - for example, this could allow one to control a WonderSwan as an audio synthesizer.

Special thanks to [BluRaf](https://mastodon.sdf.org/@BluRaf) for providing support and advice through my first journey into TinyUSB lands.

## Tips

* If you mute the USB audio device, the WonderSwan will consider the headphones as disconnected, re-enabling the internal speaker.

## Build Instructions

* Copy `pico_sdk_import.cmake` from your Pico-SDK installation to the repository's root.
* Run `mkdir build`, `cd build`, `cmake ..`, `make`.

## Installation Instructions (Raspberry Pi Pico)

* Flash the program to the Pico: for example, `picotool load -v -x extfriend.uf2`
* Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to [the WonderSwan's EXT port](http://daifukkat.su/docs/wsman/#pinout_extport). The default build of ExtFriend uses seven consecutive Pi Pico pins, as follows:
  * EXT GND - Pico GND (for example pin 3)
  * EXT SER_MOSI - Pico pin 2 (GP1)
  * EXT SER_MISO - Pico pin 1 (GP0)
  * If you want to use digital audio capture:
    * EXT HDPN_BCLK - Pico pin 7 (GP5)
    * EXT HDPN_LRCK - Pico pin 6 (GP4)
    * EXT HDPN_SDAT - Pico pin 5 (GP3)
    * EXT /HDPN_DETECT - Pico pin 4 (GP2)

If you don't have an EXT port plug or cable handy, you can use an HDMI breakout board. An example instruction guide is provided [here](https://twitter.com/peca_port0/status/1631569109912817667) (in Japanese), for a $2 AliExpress board.
